## Hide My History

A good extension to hide your secrets in the deepest area of your browser.

### Features

Here are some features that I have done, including some that I have planned:

- [x] Incognito without `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `N`. You can just click the Extension icon and enable Incognito mode to stop
  browser recording history.
- [x] Black/white list for domains. If a domain is added to blacklist, its history will be recorded while a domain in a
  whitelist results its browsing history will not be recorded even without Incognito mode enabled.
- [x] Add website to black/white list using context menu (right click on any webpage).
- [x] Enable/disable Incognito mode with right click.
- [x] A hidden history section. You enabled Incognito mode or add a domain to whitelist then suddenly close a tab
  casting a random movie that you interest? No worry, removed browsing history items are saved in an isolated place,
  allow you to visit back what you have left behind.
- [x] Sensitive information are encrypted. As above, url, titles are encrypted to make sure your parents will not know.
  They will not know, I'm sure, even if they were hackers.
- [ ] Black/white list for keywords. If you add `cornhub` into the keyword whitelist, everytime you visit a website with
  url includes `cornhub` will not record history.
- [ ] Incognito at tab level, only prevent browsing history on a single browsing tab.

### Development

Clone this project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/monokaijs/hide-my-history
cd ./hide-my-history
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

... then do what ever you want

```shell
yarn dev
```

Take your time, my hurry makes this repo such a mess. It would take time to know whatever I have done. I don't even know
what I had done, maybe you should ask Jesus.
